# Get_Next_Line

The get_next_line function takes a file descriptor and a pointer to a string as arguments. It processes the data read from the given file descriptor and determines the next line, which is then copied to the given string pointer. This process is repeated when the function is called again, for processing the next line.

The get_next_line function can be used with multiple file descriptors and can read data from multiple files by using an array of variables. Additionally, the function must be designed to work securely, without any memory leaks, by properly using the malloc and free functions.
